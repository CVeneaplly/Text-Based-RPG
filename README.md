---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                             
                                                             -------------------How To Play-------------------
When not in battle

1. Press 'W', 'S', 'A', or 'D' to move and trigger a description of the place that the player might be seeing.
2. Press 'H' to heal.
3. Press 'R' to remove an item
4. Press 'I' to look at the inventory.

When in Battle

1. Press 'E' to attack
2. Press 'H' to heal
You can only attack or heal in the given turn. After your turn, the enemy will make their move.

Aditionally, you can press 'Q' to quit any time you want.

Please wait until the entire text is displayed. The animation effect is not skippable but the program continues to take inputs. 

So, give your inputs only when the games asks you to do so. This is to avoid unintentional or accidental moves.

Remember to press 'Enter' after every input. Your move will not be made until the 'Enter' key is pressed.
